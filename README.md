# Radio Sync Resynchronized
Little QoL mod to share custom radio songs from host to other clients. \
Downloading the songs from the host is a little slow. (working on it) \
The custom songs will only start playing after the first song is done playing for the host, so if you don't hear anything, it's not broken (probably), just wait a minute. \
This mod downloads all the songs from the host's custom radio folder (under 32mb) into your own custom radio folder.

## Install 
1. Download and install [Melonloader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest/).
2. Download the compiled mod from the [Releases](https://github.com/DeltaNeverUsed/TheLongDriveSyncRadio/releases/latest/) tab.
3. Put the mod dll into the Mods folder in The Long Drive's folder
4. And you're done!

Credits to DeltaNeverUsed for creating the initial mod! Sadly the last push on it was too long ago, so I decided to pick it up and tinker around it.
