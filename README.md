# Radio Sync, Resynchronized (original by DeltaNeverUsed)
Little QoL mod to share custom radio songs from host to other clients. \
Downloading the songs from the host is a little slow. (working on it) \
The custom songs will only start playing after the first song is done playing for the host, so if you don't hear anything, it's not broken (probably), just wait a minute. \
This mod downloads all the songs from the host's custom radio folder (under 32mb) into your own custom radio folder.

## Install 
1. Download and install [Melonloader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest/).
2. Download the compiled mod from the [Releases](https://github.com/DeltaNeverUsed/TheLongDriveSyncRadio/releases/latest/) tab.
3. Put the mod dll into the Mods folder in The Long Drive's folder
4. And you're done!
